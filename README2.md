Implementing a custom context holder involves several best practices to ensure that it functions correctly and efficiently. Here are some of them:

1. **Thread Safety**: The context holder should be thread-safe since it will be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. This can be achieved by using `ThreadLocal` variables in Java.

2. **Clearing Context**: Always clear the context at the end of the request to prevent memory leaks and incorrect data being available in the next request.

3. **Immutable Context Data**: The data stored in the context should be immutable to prevent any accidental modifications once it's set.

4. **Singleton Pattern**: The context holder should be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance exists in the JVM.

5. **Lazy Initialization**: Initialize the context data lazily, i.e., on the first usage. This can save resources if the context data is not needed.

6. **Documentation**: Document the usage of the context holder clearly, as it's a cross-cutting concern and can impact multiple parts of the application.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement a custom context holder in Java:

```java
public class CustomContextHolder {
    private static final ThreadLocal<Context> userContext = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void setContext(Context context) {
        userContext.set(context);
    }

    public static Context getContext() {
        return userContext.get();
    }

    public static void clearContext() {
        userContext.remove();
    }

    public static class Context {
        private final String userId;
        private final String vipLevel;
        private final BigDecimal walletBalance;

        public Context(String userId, String vipLevel, BigDecimal walletBalance) {
            this.userId = userId;
            this.vipLevel = vipLevel;
            this.walletBalance = walletBalance;
        }

        // getters
    }
}
```

In this example, `CustomContextHolder` is a utility class that provides static methods to set, get, and clear the context. The context data is stored in a `ThreadLocal` variable to ensure thread safety. The `Context` class is an immutable class that holds the context data.

A custom context holder is typically used in scenarios where you need to share common data across different parts of an application during a single request. Here are some common use cases:

1. **User Authentication**: In web applications, once a user is authenticated, their details can be stored in a context holder. This allows other parts of the application to easily access user information without needing to re-authenticate the user.

2. **Transaction Management**: In a transactional system, a context holder can be used to store transaction-related data, such as the transaction ID or status. This can be useful in scenarios where multiple services or components participate in a single transaction.

3. **Logging**: A context holder can be used to store information that needs to be logged consistently across all log entries within a single request, such as a request ID or user ID.

4. **Locale Settings**: In internationalized applications, a context holder can be used to store the user's locale settings. This allows different parts of the application to easily access and use these settings to provide localized content.

5. **Security and Authorization**: Similar to user authentication, once a user's roles and permissions are determined, they can be stored in a context holder. This allows other parts of the application to easily check the user's permissions without needing to re-fetch them.

6. **Performance Monitoring**: A context holder can be used to store performance-related data, such as the start time of a request. This allows different parts of the application to easily access this data for performance monitoring and optimization.

Implementing a custom context holder often involves the use of several design patterns to ensure its functionality and efficiency. Here are some of them:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: The context holder should be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance exists in the JVM. This is important because the context holder is a global point of access to a particular service or operation in your application.

2. **Factory Pattern**: The factory pattern can be used to create and return instances of the Context class. This can be useful if the creation process is complex or if you want to control how and when contexts are created.

3. **Strategy Pattern**: If you have different types of contexts that need to be handled differently, you can use the strategy pattern. This allows you to define a family of algorithms (i.e., different ways of handling context), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.

4. **Decorator Pattern**: If you need to add responsibilities to your context holder dynamically, you can use the decorator pattern. This allows you to add functionality to an object without affecting other objects of the same class.

5. **Observer Pattern**: If the state of your context can change and other parts of your application need to react to those changes, you can use the observer pattern. This allows objects to observe and react to state changes in other objects.

Here's a basic example of how you might implement a custom context holder using the Singleton and Factory patterns in Java:

```java
public class CustomContextHolder {
    private static final ThreadLocal<Context> userContext = new ThreadLocal<>();

    private CustomContextHolder() {
        // private constructor to enforce Singleton pattern
    }

    public static CustomContextHolder getInstance() {
        return Holder.INSTANCE;
    }

    public static void setContext(Context context) {
        userContext.set(context);
    }

    public static Context getContext() {
        return userContext.get();
    }

    public static void clearContext() {
        userContext.remove();
    }

    private static class Holder {
        private static final CustomContextHolder INSTANCE = new CustomContextHolder();
    }

    public static class Context {
        private final String userId;
        private final String vipLevel;
        private final BigDecimal walletBalance;

        public Context(String userId, String vipLevel, BigDecimal walletBalance) {
            this.userId = userId;
            this.vipLevel = vipLevel;
            this.walletBalance = walletBalance;
        }

        // getters
    }
}
```

In this example, `CustomContextHolder` is a utility class that provides static methods to set, get, and clear the context. The context data is stored in a `ThreadLocal` variable to ensure thread safety. The `Context` class is an immutable class that holds the context data. The Singleton pattern is enforced by making the constructor private and providing a static `getInstance` method. The Factory pattern is used to create instances of the `Context` class.

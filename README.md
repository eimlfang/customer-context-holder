# Custom context holder

The goal of this project is to make a custom context holder which like Spring security context holder.

1. [ ] Create a custom context holder
2. [ ] When customer account (mock) visit `/shopping/**` to buy things, set the custom context holder with the user info, 
so we can get customer info, like VIP level, wallet balance under `/shopping/**`.
3. [ ] The lifecycle of the custom context holder should be the same as the request lifecycle(session?).


# Custom Context Holder

The objective of this project is to develop a custom context holder similar to the context holder in Spring Security.

1. [ ] Construct a custom context holder.
2. [ ] When a customer account (mock) visits `/shopping/**` to make purchases, populate the custom context holder with user information. This allows us to retrieve customer details, such as VIP level and wallet balance, under `/shopping/**`.
3. [ ] The lifecycle of the custom context holder should align with the request lifecycle (perhaps a session?).
